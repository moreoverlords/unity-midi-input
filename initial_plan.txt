This is a bunch of brainstorming I did a while ago for the essential mechanics for the game.
Nothing here is set in stone (barring the base concept of piano fighting game, that's kinda the point of this project).



NAME IDEAS:

Maestro
Virtuoso
Crescendo
Forte
Fortissimo
Sonata
Allegro
Keyboard Warrior(s)


GAME IDEAS:
piano-controlled fighting game
  fighting games have too many buttons? PSH NOW THEY DO
  
left hand, bass controls movement

right hand, treble does attacks

individual notes/triads/chords are simple attacks, famous melodies are combos
  individual note: light attack
  triad: medium attack
  chord: heavy attack

pitch of notes determines attack position (high/low)?
  I like this, it makes it difficult to do high->low attack or vice versa, just as it's hard to block that
  
off-key attacks do reduced damage

combo input windows are generous, but they must stay on-tempo
  so no 1-frame links, but have to honour the rhythm of the tune
  
is there a set tempo for both players?
  I don't think so, this is too restrictive, timings are already predictable, shouldn't make it more so

characters are famous composers (Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky)
  cute chibi style

stage select determines key
  combos are transposed
  notes available in the scale change

IMPLEMENTATION:
Universal Fighting Engine (UFE)? $65-100 (15% off students)

TODO:
get a cheap keyboard peripheral, usb-connecting
get midi inputs into unity (https://github.com/keijiro/unity-midi-input)
set up basic dummy character in UFE
create a few basic animations/moves (high punch, low kick, hadoken)
set up character hitboxes
get keyboard inputs to trigger attacks
  may need an input parsing layer, since we don't want one-to-one key->move mappings
  inputs should be received (lazily packaged into strings based on input/tempo), then validated and parsed into a move
    then trigger that move
  hopefully this is possible in UFE, ideally don't want to hack things too hard
